## What is A/B Testing?

A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two variations (A and B) of a product, feature, or marketing campaign to determine which one performs better. By presenting different versions to separate user groups and analyzing their responses, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize user experience and business outcomes.

## How Does A/B Testing Work?

1. **Define the Hypothesis:** Clearly state what you aim to test (e.g., "Version B will result in a higher conversion rate than Version A").
2. **Split Your Audience:** Randomly divide your audience into two groups: one sees Version A (control), and the other sees Version B (variant).
3. **Run the Experiment:** Allow users to interact with the versions for a sufficient period.
4. **Measure Performance:** Collect metrics like clicks, sign-ups, or sales for both groups.
5. **Analyze Results:** Use statistical tests to determine which version performed better.
