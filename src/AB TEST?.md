## What is A/B Testing?

A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two variations (A and B) of a product, feature, or marketing campaign to determine which one performs better. By presenting different versions to separate user groups and analyzing their responses, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize user experience and business outcomes.

## Why Use A/B Testing?

- **Data-driven Decisions:** Eliminate guesswork and rely on quantitative evidence.
- **Optimize Conversions:** Improve KPIs like click-through rates, purchase rates, or engagement.
- **Understand User Behavior:** Gain insights into user preferences and behavior.

## How Does A/B Testing Work?

1. **Define the Hypothesis:** Clearly state what you aim to test (e.g., "Version B will result in a higher conversion rate than Version A").
2. **Split Your Audience:** Randomly divide your audience into two groups: one sees Version A (control), and the other sees Version B (variant).
3. **Run the Experiment:** Allow users to interact with the versions for a sufficient period.
4. **Measure Performance:** Collect metrics like clicks, sign-ups, or sales for both groups.
5. **Analyze Results:** Use statistical tests to determine which version performed better.

## Key Metrics and Equations

### 1. Conversion Rate
The conversion rate is the percentage of users who complete a desired action.

CR = (Number of Conversions / Total Users) * 100


### 2. Standard Error (SE)
The standard error measures the variability of the conversion rate.

SE = sqrt((CR * (1 - CR)) / n)

Where:
- `CR`: Conversion rate
- `n`: Number of users

### 3. Z-Score
The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean. For A/B testing:

Z = (CR_B - CR_A) / sqrt(SE_A^2 + SE_B^2)

Where:
- `CR_A`: Conversion rate of group A
- `CR_B`: Conversion rate of group B
- `SE_A`, `SE_B`: Standard errors for groups A and B

### 4. P-Value
The p-value helps determine whether the observed difference is statistically significant. It is derived from the Z-score.

### 5. Statistical Significance
To determine if the results are significant, compare the p-value to a significance threshold (commonly 0.05). If:


p <= 0.05(alpha is generally 0.05 or %5), the result is statistically significant.
